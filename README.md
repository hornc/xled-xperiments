# xled-xperiments
Using a 3x3 [Twinlky square](https://twinkly.com/products/squares) grid as a 24x24 led screen, with [xled](https://github.com/scrool/xled) and [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame)

A collection of experiments to see what we can make with it; simulations, and interactive "games".

**TODO:**
* read led matrix configuration from the device and use it, rather than the current hardcoded-to-my-layout
